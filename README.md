# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This repo contains a copy of the gilded rose refactoring Kata hosted by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt). I am reproducing as a challenge to complete for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)
I have only kept the JavaScript Kata.



## Tests

I have refactored the JavaScript file with legacy code which is located under js/public/js/originalFile.js

I have removed the old version of Jasmine testing framework, and I have replaced it with a more recent version. In order to run the test, you can open the file which is located under spec/frontend/SpecRunner.html

The refactored file can be found under js/public/js/gildedRose.js
