# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This repo contains a copy of the gilded rose refactoring Kata hosted by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt). I am reproducing as a challenge to complete for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)
I have only kept the JavaScript Kata.
